# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. The application is built using the Streamlit framework for an interactive user interface and leverages scikit-learn and pandas for machine learning and data manipulation.

## Project Highlights

1. **Streamlit UI:**
   - Developed an intuitive user interface using Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization of diabetes predictions.

2. **Machine Learning Frameworks:**
   - Implemented machine learning models using scikit-learn for accurate prediction based on features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, and BMI.

3. **Data Processing with pandas:**
   - Utilized pandas for efficient data manipulation, ensuring the data is prepared and cleaned for model training.

4. **End-to-End Workflow:**
   - Demonstrated proficiency in an end-to-end data science workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to interactive result presentation with Streamlit.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Run the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   - Execute the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

3. **Access the App:**
   - Once the app is running, open your web browser and navigate to the provided local address (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

4. **Interact with the App:**
   - Use the interactive interface to input data and receive predictions for diabetes likelihood.

Feel free to customize the instructions based on your project structure and dependencies. This `readme.md` provides a brief overview, project highlights, and instructions on how to run the Streamlit app.
